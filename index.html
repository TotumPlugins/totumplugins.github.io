What if any plugins you installed were guaranteed to work together, even down to the simplest of commands? What if each of these plugins was fully customisable to the needs of your own server - a place where you'd much rather spend sixty seconds configuring and sixty minutes playing, rather than the other way around.</h3>

<p>Built from the ground up to work in such a way, Totum is clean, speedy and elegant. The main driving force behind the project being ease-of-use for you, the user, we plan on implementing hundreds of features to make Totum as easy for you as possible. Automatic module installation and updating, instantaneous permissions configuration, advanced plugin integration, non-existent compatibility issues - with Totum, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<a name="what-are-totum-modules" class="anchor" href="#what-are-totum-modules"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are Totum modules?</h3>

<p>Totum modules are almost a plugin with-in a plugin. The core Totum plugin provides many key features and must be present for any modules to work, but adds no functionality - that all comes with the modules. Each module is designed around and implemented through Totum, yet shows as a separate Bukkit plugin - this makes it extra-easy to configure and experiment with.</p>

<a name="how-do-i-get-totum-modules" class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-get-totum-modules"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do I get Totum modules?</h3>

<p>Currently any modules are being developed solely by the Totum team, and can be downloaded from their separate GitHub repositories (and soon, on BukkitDev). While we hope to have as many modules as possible rolling out soon, it is simply impractical and unfeasible to roll them all out at once - soon you'll be able to vote for which module you'd like to be released next, and we'll hop right on it. Note that each and every module requires the Totum Core.</p>
